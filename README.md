### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- I'm an iOS developer experienced in developing quality iOS apps, leading cross-functional development teams, and coaching/teaching iOS Development and Computer Science. 
- I have been a lifelong student of programming starting in high school with Pascal and most recently learning iOS development with Swift and Objective-C. 
- I have also spent years teaching or coaching a variety of subjects, including TaeKwonDo, Workplace Safety, and most recently, iOS Development. 
- Currently I'm working at an exciting start up, WeVidit, helping build their iOS app.
